        Vocab Battle is a daily game that challenges your vocab skills. Every day you receive a new theme. 
        In 30 seconds, you must come up with as many words as you can that relate to or are synonyms for that theme. 
        The more words you get, the higher your score!
      </p>

      <p>
        On the home page, select begin to see the theme for the day and begin. Once the time has started, enter your words in the spaces, as shown in the picture below. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Once the time has run out, your answers will be automatically submitted and checked for validity! 
        If you are unable to think of more words and want to submit early, select the submit button.
